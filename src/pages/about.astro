  <Hero title="About Honey-Do Heroes">
    <p>
      We’re a local team of parents and neighbors on Long Island who know how to fix things — from drywall and painting to smart devices and Wi-Fi. We combine traditional handyman skills with modern tech know-how, so you don’t have to call two different people for the same job.

      Our goal is simple: to make homeownership easier by being the crew you can trust for jobs mid-size to small. Whether it’s patching a wall, painting a room, setting up your smart thermostat, or checking off a few honey-do items, we’re here to help. And if you don’t see your project listed, just call or email — chances are, we can take care of it.
