        About Honey-Do Heroes
      </h1>
      <p class="text-center text-lg text-gray-300">
        We’re a local team of dads and neighbors in Floral Park who know how to
        fix things — from drywall and painting to smart devices and Wi-Fi. We
        combine traditional handyman skills with modern tech know-how, so you
        don’t have to call two different people for the same job.
      </p>

        Our goal is simple: make homeownership easier by being the crew you can
        trust for any task, big or small.
